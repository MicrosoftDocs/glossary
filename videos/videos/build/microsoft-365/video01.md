## Details

<p>Learn from Core Services Engineering &amp; Operations (formerly Microsoft IT) software engineering leads and our Digital Security &amp; Risk Engineering (DSRE) engineers how our Line of Business application development teams work hand in hand with our security experts to implement tools and patterns to secure our cloud footprint while accelerating the speed at which our software engineers build applications in the cloud. Based on one of our own internal security &#43; development training sessions, you’ll hear from the experts how they maximize developer time while still maintaining compliance and proven security practices. You’ll also get a view into how this works in reality with one of our software engineering team’s subscriptions – how they set up resource groups, least privilege access, CI/CD permissions and more.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree">https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree</a></p> (01:07:09)

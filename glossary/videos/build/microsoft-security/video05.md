## Details

<p>In this video we'll show you how Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Manual Testing capability enables you to plan and execute tests against your next app or website project. We will show you how configure multiple configurations for your test setup (example: OS &amp; Browser combos), how to create a test plan, and execute a test. We also cover how tests can link to the work your team needs to do to fix problems and all activity has full traceability with test run history and links between work and executed tests. For more information see our documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/manual-test/?view=vsts</p> (00:07:55)

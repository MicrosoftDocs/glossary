## Details

Easily build distinctive conversational bots, with zero editorial effort using Project Personality Chat. Personality Chat enhances your botâ€™s conversational capabilities by handling small talk, in line with a chosen personality. Choose a personality that aligns with your brand's voice, by choosing from available default personas. Personality Chat uses intent classifiers to identify common small talk intents, and generates responses consistent with the personality. Based on the intent and the confidence scores, it either chooses the best response from a curated editorial base or generates it real-time using deep neural networks (DNNs). (00:17:10)

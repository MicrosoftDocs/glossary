## Details

Volumetric video is a new and powerful type of content that allows us to bring holographic human performances to Mixed Reality experiences. Microsoftâ€™s technology supports capture and playback of sophisticated multi-actor performances, while compressing to stream to reach mobile devices like HoloLens or even common cellphones. In this session we will learn a bit about the tech, how to integrate it into an application, and get a glimpse inside the workings of the custom content capture/generation process. (00:17:22)

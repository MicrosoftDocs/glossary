## Details

Collaboration is a critical component of modern development teams, especially when they’re distributed and/or releasing rapidly. Traditional options such as screen sharing and version control weren’t designed for the real-time, bi-directional needs of effective pair programming, and so new tools and services are needed to help fill this increasingly critical gap.

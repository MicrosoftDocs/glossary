## Details

<p>H2O’s AI platform provides open source machine learning framework that works with sparklyr and PySpark. H2O’s Sparkling Water allows users to combine the fast, scalable machine learning algorithms of H2O with the capabilities of Spark. With Sparkling Water, users can drive computation from Scala/R/Python and utilize the H2O Flow UI, providing an ideal machine learning platform for application developers. H2O's open AutoML also fully automates the process training ML algorithms, tuning the right parameters and building ensemble models. Setting up an environment to perform advanced analytics on top of big data is hard, but with H2O Sparkling Water for HDInsight, customers can get started with just a few clicks. This solution will install Sparkling Water on an HDInsight Spark cluster so you can exploit all the benefits from both Spark and H2O. The solution can access data from Azure Blob storage and/or Azure Data Lake Store in addition to all the standard data sources that H2O support. It also provides Jupyter Notebooks with in-built examples for an easy jumpstart, and a user-friendly H2O FLOW UI to monitor and debug the applications.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree">https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree</a></p> (00:24:05)

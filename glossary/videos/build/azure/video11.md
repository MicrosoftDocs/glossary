## Details

<p>The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has led to an explosion of 3D model content. These models are highly detailed virtual versions of buildings, infrastructure, and machines used to (pre) construct the built environment. The challenge with such models and mixed reality is how to get such content to the HoloLens and also support interactions with the data. Loading the models to the devise is not practical, so we are exploring streaming stereoscopic frames to the HoloLens over Wi-Fi. The models are running on Azure-Hosted GPU infrastructure that is best suited for these large datasets. The presentation will show our various prototypes, our latest working solution, lessons learned, and where we are headed next.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree">https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree</a></p> (00:22:08)

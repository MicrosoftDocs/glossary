## Details

<p>In this hands-on presentation, learn about the true value of Event Grid by seeing an example in action. You'll be able to understand what sets Event Grid apart from other services like Service Bus and messaging queues. Event Grid is an Azure service that routes events between endpoints. It provides support for virtually any existing Azure service from storage activity to serverless Azure Function calls. It also has support for custom end points. Instead of taking on the costly overhead of continuous polling in your applications, Event Grid will manage the events for you and publish them to your app when ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/azft-serverless">https://aka.ms/azft-serverless</a></p> (00:21:09)

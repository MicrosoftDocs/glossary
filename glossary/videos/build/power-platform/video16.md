## Details

<p>Building real time features into a web application has become a common demand from web developers. One of the open source libraries with both server and client side support used by web developers, especially for .Net developers, is SignalR - a top level .NET library, designed for this purpose. Hosting and managing SignalR Server in the cloud, handling many con-current connections, and scaling independently from the web applications are not trivial tasks. This session will demonstrate how to easily develop, deploy and monitor the real time web application using the Azure SignalR Service. We will also cover programming models for typical real time web application scenarios, and demonstrate how to easily develop, deploy and monitor the real time web application using the Azure SignalR Service.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree">https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree</a></p> (00:22:28)

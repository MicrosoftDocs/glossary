## Details

<p>The Azure ML SDK for Python provides a single control plane API to the data scientist to execute the key AML workflows of Provisioning Compute, Model Training, Model Deployment and Scoring entirely in Python. During this session, we will demonstrate how all these activities are done with just a few lines of Python code executed from your notebook or script running on your local machine or in the cloud.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/azft-ml">https://aka.ms/azft-ml</a></p> (00:23:56)

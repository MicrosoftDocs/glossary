## Details

<p>DevOps is about people, process and products. Getting it all right requires effort but the benefits to your organization and customers can be huge. Microsoft has a fantastic set of products that can adapt to any language on any platform. In this demo heavy session, starting from just a blank desktop, we will create a new DevOps project and a complete pipeline. We will show you how to deploy to a number of different Azure services, all live and hands on.</p><p>Create a Free Account (Azure): <a href="https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree">https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree</a></p> (00:58:49)
